- **Content Exclusion**: Users and organizations can configure Copilot to ignore certain files, ensuring sensitive or proprietary code is not used to train models.
- **Usage Data**: Organizations with enterprise subscriptions can review Copilot usage data to manage access and adoption effectively.
- **Audit Logs**: Available for administrators to review actions taken by users, enhancing transparency and security​
## Prompt Crafting and Prompt Engineering:
### General tips:
#### Start general and get more specific
Top Down principle 
> [!example] 
> Write a function that tells me if a number is prime
> The function should take an integer and return true if the integer is prime
> The function should give an error if the input is not a positive integer> 

#### Give examples
Add context to your prompts
> [!example]
> Write a function that identifies dates in a string and returns them. Dates can have formats like: 
 > - 31/07/2024
>  - 2024-07-01
> 

>[!tip] 
> Examples might be as well be unit test
> 

#### break complex tasks into simpler tasks
kind of obvious should be done in development anyways
>[!example]  
>- Write a function to generate a 10 by 10 grid of letters.
  > - Write a function to find all words in a grid of letters, given a list of valid words.
  > - Write a function to that uses the previous functions to generate a 10 by 10 grid of letters that contains at least 10 words.
  > - Update the previous function to print the grid of letters and 10 random words from the grid.

#### avoid ambiguity
be explicit in what you want Copilot to do
>[!example]
>*What does function X do?* rather than *what does this piece of code do?* 
#### indicate relevant code
In your IDE use references to indicate relevant code to Copilot [[#Prompting in the IDE - VS Code]]
#### experiment and iterate
Work with previous responses where it makes sense to keep context for Copilot or use */clear* to reset context
#### keep history relevant
To keep history relevant use threads => start new conversations to keep history of certain topics. Delete requests that are not needed anymore or took a wrong turn
#### follow good coding practices
Like when developing one your own (clean code):
- consistant coding style
- descriptive names
- comments where needed
- adhere to rules to structure code (modules, components, etc)
- include unit tests
>[!tip] 
>use Copilot as support for that as well by asking for tips on coding practices. Works also for other areas like asking for possible vulnerabilities

### Best practices, examples and tips:
#### Set the stage with a high level goal:
Example:
``` /* Create a basic markdown editor in Next.js with the following features: - Use react hooks - Create state for markdown with default text "type markdown here" - A text area where users can write markdown - Show a live preview of the markdown text as I type - Support for basic markdown syntax like headers, bold, italics - Use React markdown npm package - The markdown text and resulting HTML should be saved in the component's state and updated in real time */ ```

#### Make your ask simple and specific
After the main goal go more into the details but be specfic and let Copilot generate steps and not the whole solution at once => better outcome.
### Work with examples
When providing details and examples Copilot has an easier time understand intentions.
Example:
Provide examples including values and not only structure for a JSON for which Copilot should generate a DTO.
### Experiment with prompts:
use threads to seperate different prompts and do not hesitate to open a new thread to try a different approach

### Keep relevant tabs open
Neighboring tabs are used as context for prompts => adds automatically details

#### Stay smart:
double check provided solutions

## Privacy fundamentals and content exclusions:
#### Privacy Fundamentals

GitHub Copilot is designed with privacy considerations to protect user data while enhancing productivity. The service collects data to improve its machine learning models, but it also includes measures to respect user privacy and data security:

1. **Data Collection**:
    
    - GitHub Copilot collects telemetry data, which includes interactions like code completions and modifications, to improve its suggestions. This data is anonymized to protect individual privacy.
    - Copilot also logs how users interact with suggestions, including acceptance, rejection, or modification, to refine its algorithms.
2. **User Control**:
    
    - Users have control over their data and can manage settings to limit what Copilot accesses and logs. This includes the ability to disable Copilot entirely if desired.
    - Privacy settings are available to customize data sharing preferences, ensuring users can opt out of any data collection they are uncomfortable with.

#### Content Exclusions

Content exclusions are a crucial feature for organizations using GitHub Copilot, ensuring that sensitive or proprietary code is not used to train Copilot's models. Here’s how content exclusions work:

1. **Setting Up Exclusions**:
    
    - Organizations can specify files or directories that GitHub Copilot should ignore. This is done by configuring content exclusions in the repository or organization settings.
    - Paths can be specified using pattern matching (e.g., `*.secret` to exclude all files with `.secret` extension) to ensure comprehensive exclusion of sensitive data.
2. **Configuration Process**:
    
    - To set up content exclusions, organization owners need to navigate to the Copilot settings within their GitHub organization settings. Here, they can list repositories and paths to be excluded from Copilot’s analysis.
    - The configuration allows using different repository references and pattern matching to tailor the exclusions precisely to organizational needs.
3. **Monitoring and Auditing**:
    
    - Changes to content exclusions are logged, and organization owners can review these changes. This includes details about who made the changes and when, ensuring transparency and accountability.
    - Audit logs help in tracking modifications to exclusion settings, providing an extra layer of security and oversight.
## GitHub Copilot Docsets: An Overview

**GitHub Copilot Docsets** are a feature that provides developers with access to collections of documentation directly integrated with GitHub Copilot.

## GitHub Copilot CLI basics:
The GitHub Copilot CLI (Command Line Interface) provides several key commands to enhance your command-line experience using AI assistance directly in the terminal. Here are the main commands available:

1. **`gh copilot suggest [description]`**: This command suggests a command based on the description you provide. For example, you could run `gh copilot suggest "create a new Git branch"` to receive a suggestion for the appropriate command.
    
2. **`gh copilot explain [command]`**: This command explains the functionality of a given command. For instance, you can use `gh copilot explain "git rebase"` to get a detailed explanation of what that command does.
    
3. **`gh copilot alias`**: This command generates shell-specific aliases for convenience. These aliases (`ghcs` and `ghce`) can be used to quickly invoke the `suggest` and `explain` functionalities without typing the full command.
    
4. **`gh copilot config`**: This command allows you to configure options for the Copilot CLI, such as changing the default behavior for command execution confirmations.
    

These commands help streamline your workflow by providing AI-driven suggestions and explanations directly within your terminal, making it easier to work with complex or unfamiliar commands

## GitHub Copilot and Azure DevOps
### 1. **Licensing Requirements:**

- **GitHub Copilot**: To use GitHub Copilot, users need an active subscription, either through individual, business, or enterprise plans provided by GitHub. This subscription is specifically for Copilot and is independent of any Azure DevOps licensing.
- **Azure DevOps**: Azure DevOps services (like pipelines, repos, and boards) require their own licensing and subscription plans. These are separate from GitHub Copilot. If you're using Azure DevOps, you'll need to ensure you have the necessary licenses for the services you plan to use.

### 2. **Integration Scenarios:**

- **Using GitHub Copilot with Azure Repos**: While GitHub Copilot is primarily designed to work seamlessly with GitHub repositories, it can also be used with code hosted in Azure Repos, provided that the development environment (like VS Code) where Copilot is enabled is set up to access those Azure Repos. The Copilot subscription still applies in this scenario.
- **Enterprise Integration**: For enterprises that use both GitHub and Azure DevOps, it's possible to manage and integrate workflows across both platforms. However, each platform’s services must be licensed separately. For example, GitHub Actions can be used in conjunction with Azure DevOps pipelines, but this doesn't negate the need for separate licensing.

### 3. **Cost Implications:**

- **Separate Cost Centers**: The costs associated with GitHub Copilot and Azure DevOps are billed separately. Even if an organization uses both platforms, the subscription for Copilot is not included in Azure DevOps licenses, and vice versa.
- **Bundled Offerings**: Microsoft may offer bundled pricing or discounts for enterprises using multiple Microsoft products, including GitHub and Azure DevOps, but these are usually part of broader enterprise agreements and not specific to Copilot.

### 4. **Management and Compliance**:

- **Admin Control**: If you're an organization using both Azure DevOps and GitHub (with Copilot), administrators will need to manage licensing and access separately through the respective portals (Azure Portal for Azure DevOps and GitHub Enterprise for Copilot).
- **Compliance**: Both GitHub Copilot and Azure DevOps must adhere to the organization's compliance policies. For example, if certain repositories or codebases need to comply with specific regulatory standards, these must be managed across both platforms.

In summary, while GitHub Copilot and Azure DevOps can be used together in a development workflow, their licensing and costs are managed independently. Organizations need to ensure they have appropriate subscriptions for both tools if they plan to integrate them into their development processes.
